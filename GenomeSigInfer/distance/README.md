# DISTANCE

The `distance` module provides functions for calculating optimal column assignments between two DataFrames based on the linear sum assignment and calculating Jensen-Shannon distance for each pair of columns.

The `cosine` module contains functions that calculates the most similar column based on cosine similarity for a given DataFrame containing signature data.
