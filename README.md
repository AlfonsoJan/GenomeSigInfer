# Building Mutational Signatures in Cancer using Deep Bayesian Neural Nets

This project aims to refine the statistical model and the current representation of mutations in building mutational signatures in cancer using deep Bayesian neural nets. Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled growth of cells, which is primarily acquired by mutation of the genome. These mutations have accrued by exposure to DNA-damaging processes coming from within (endogenous) and from outside (exogenous) throughout the course of life. By looking at the direct context of the mutations, we can infer the way these mutations were created (aetiology).

## Introduction

Cancer is a disease of the genome, characterized by uncontrolled growth of cells acquired by mutation of the genome. These mutations have accrued by exposure to DNA-damaging processes coming from within and outside throughout the course of life. By looking at the direct context of the mutations, we can infer the way these mutations were created (aetiology). Most researchers have looked at the changing mutation including a single letter of context to the left and right. This has resulted in a curated set of mutational signatures by COSMIC, which can be viewed online. In addition, several methods have been developed to determine the signatures and infer the attributions. The goal of this project is to refine the statistical model and the current representation of the mutations.
