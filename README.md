# Building Mutational Signatures in Cancer using Deep Bayesian Neural Nets

This project aims to refine the statistical model and the current representation of mutations in building mutational signatures in cancer using deep Bayesian neural nets. Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled growth of cells, which is primarily acquired by mutation of the genome. These mutations have accrued by exposure to DNA-damaging processes coming from within (endogenous) and from outside (exogenous) throughout the course of life. By looking at the direct context of the mutations, we can infer the way these mutations were created (aetiology).

## Introduction

Cancer is a disease of the genome, characterized by uncontrolled growth of cells acquired by mutation of the genome. These mutations have accrued by exposure to DNA-damaging processes coming from within and outside throughout the course of life. By looking at the direct context of the mutations, we can infer the way these mutations were created (aetiology). Most researchers have looked at the changing mutation including a single letter of context to the left and right. This has resulted in a curated set of mutational signatures by COSMIC, which can be viewed online. In addition, several methods have been developed to determine the signatures and infer the attributions. The goal of this project is to refine the statistical model and the current representation of the mutations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

### `scripts`

The `scripts` contains executable scripts that perform specific tasks or experiments within the project.

### `DeepBayesMutSig/DeepBayesMutSig`

`DeepBayesMutSig/DeepBayesMutSig` contains modules, which are reusable units of code that perform specific functions or provide features. Each module focuses on a distinct aspect of the project's functionality.

### `data`

The `data` folder is intended for storing datasets or data files used in the project.

### `documents`

The `documents` folder contains important documents related to school, research, or any relevant materials. These documents may include academic papers, project proposals, and other resources that contribute to the understanding and development of the project.

### `results`

The `results` folder is designated for storing output files, plots, or any results generated by the code.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository & Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/AlfonsoJan/DeepBayesMutSig
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional, but recommended):

    ```bash
    $ pip install virtualenv
    $ virtualenv venv
    ```

3. Activate virtual environment

    On Windows:

    ```bash
    $ venv/Scripts/activate
    ```

    On macOS/Linux:

    ```bash
    $ source venv/bin/activat
    ```

4. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

This module provides classes and functions for performing Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
on genomic data and expanding mutation patterns. It can either run signature analysis (--spe) or perform matrix factorization (--nmf) on a CSV file.

### Setup

Install your desired reference genome to the folder output/genome.

```python
from DeepBayesMutSig import install
install.genome_install(genome="GRCh37", install_path=f"output/genome", bash=True)
```

Create csv of the NMF results of genomic data. Using scikit NMF, with 1 signature. Using 10 iterations.

```bash
$ python scripts/create_nmf_files.py -i 10 -s 1 -f path/filename
```

### Extract Signatures from a CSV file

Deconmpose mutational signatures from NMF results.

```bash
$ python scripts/mf_profiler.py -s 1 -f path/filename_nmf_result --nmf
```

If you want to extracts mutational signatures from an array of samples. Using SigProfilerExtractor, with 1 signature.

```bash
$ python scripts/nmf_profiler.py -s 1 -f path/filename --spe
```

### Param tuning

Run NMF with different combinations of initialization and beta loss and 1 signature.

```bash
$ python scripts/nmf_combinations.py -f path/filename -s 1
```

Calculate the `cosine similarity` between each file's signature data and a reference column.

```python
from DeepBayesMutSig import cosine
cosine.most_similarity_decompose("filepath")
```

### Cosine similarity

Calculates `cosine similarity` from different results, in the results folder, of the scikit NMF function using different parameters.

```bash
$ python scripts/mutation_prob_cosine.py -f results
```
