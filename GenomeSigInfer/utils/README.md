# UTILS

The `utils` module in GenomeSigInfer provides a collection of utility functions, dictionaries, and a singleton logger class to facilitate genomic analysis. These utilities include color dictionaries for mutations, decoding reference genomes, sorting functions, and classes for storing parameters used in multiple scripts.

## Singleton Logger

The SingletonLogger class ensures a consistent logging configuration throughout the application by providing a single instance of the logger. It supports logging INFO, WARNING, ERROR messages, and exceptions.
