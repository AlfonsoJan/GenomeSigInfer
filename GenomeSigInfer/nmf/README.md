# NMF

The `NMFMatrixGenerator` module in GenomeSigInfer defines the `NMFMatrixGenerator` class, which is responsible for generating NMF matrices from Single Base Substitution (SBS) data. It utilizes the `RunNMF` class for the NMF process and performs various analyses.

## RunNMF Module

The run_nmf module in GenomeSigInfer defines the RunNMF class, which is responsible for running Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on genomic data. It uses the scikit-learn library for NMF implementation.
