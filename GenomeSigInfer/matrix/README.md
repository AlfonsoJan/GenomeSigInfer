# MATRIX

The `matrix_operations` module in GenomeSigInfer provides functions for processing mutational data from VCF files and creating mutational signatures. It includes functionality for sorting chromosomes, initializing mutation DataFrames, parsing VCF files, compressing dataframes, and creating SBS (Single Base Substitution) matrices based on context.
