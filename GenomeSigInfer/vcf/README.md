# VCF

The `vcf` (Variant Call Format) module in GenomeSigInfer provides a robust set of functions for filtering and processing VCF files. This module is designed to handle multiple VCF files, extract relevant mutation information, and filter the data based on specified criteria. It utilizes the pandas library for efficient DataFrame operations and numpy for array manipulations. Additionally, the module incorporates a logging mechanism for informative logging.
